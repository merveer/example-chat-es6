It demonstrates how a complex, stateful application should be built.\r\n\r\n![demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/698308/9188378/41976688-3fe4-11e5-940d-e555f666b294.gif)\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:vieuxio/example-chat-es6.git\r\n$ cd example-chat-es6\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you are ready to run the project. After you execute this command, the project will be built and you can open `dist/index.html` with your favorite browser.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ webpack\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nThis project provides a development web server that listens on port 1973.\r\n\r\nRun\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ webpack-dev-server --port 1973\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the project will be ready for development and inspection. The server watches for file changes with hot reloading, so any change you make to the files under `src` folder will cause an automatic reload.\r\n\r\n## Production builds\r\n\r\nWhen you are satisfied with development and want to make a production build in order to deploy the app, just run the default `webpack` command and a minified bundle will be deployed under the `dist` folder.\r\n\r\nHappy coding!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
